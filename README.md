## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
I propose the development of a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application and chatbot designed to provide small farmers with personalized, real-time, and trustworthy agricultural advisory services. The solution combines scientific recommendations, traditional farming knowledge and modern engagement tools to ensure usability and adoption, even among farmers with low digital literacy.

<h1>Key Features</h1>

1.<h3>Crop & Soil Advisory</h3>

* Farmers upload a photo of the soil for analysis

* AI model suggests Smart fertilizer dosageto reduce costs and prevent overuse

<h3>2.Weather & Alert System</h3>

* Location-based weather data with simple, actionable advice.

* Timely alerts in local languages (e.g., “Heavy rain tomorrow – postpone pesticide spraying”).

<h3>3.Pest and Disease Detection</h3>

* Farmers upload a photo of affected crop.

* AI model suggests probable pest/disease and remedies

<h3>4.Farmers’ Voices – Weekend Advisory Sessions</h3>

* Weekly interviews featuring a successful traditional farmer + a modern agri-student/expert. Jointly share do’s & don’ts, practical tips, and seasonal guidance.

* Available in multiple formats: short videos, audio podcasts, and text summaries.

* Multilingual subtitles + voiceovers ensure accessibility across regions.

* Push notifications to alert farmers every weekend.

This bridges trust from peer farmers and science from students/experts, making the app engaging, credible, and community-driven.

<h3>5.Voice & Multilingual Support</h3>

* Text-to-speech and speech-to-text in regional languages.

* Designed for farmers with low literacy levels.
   


## Technical Approach
<h3>1. Mobile Application (Frontend)</h3>

* Framework: Flutter or React Native for cross-platform compatibility (Android/iOS).

* User Interface: Simple, icon-driven design with minimal text to support low literacy levels.

* Language Support: Regional language selection during onboarding; all content available in multiple Indian languages.

* Voice Interaction: Integrated text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) for easy use by non-literate farmers.

* Offline Mode: Key advisories, past interviews, and market prices cached for access without internet.

<h3>2.Backend</h3>

* Cloud Backend: Firebase or AWS for scalable, real-time data handling.

* Database: NoSQL database for storing farmer profiles, queries, and advisory logs.

<h3>3.Machine Learning</h3>

Pest & Disease Detection:

   * Use TensorFlow Lite models
    
   * Image classification pipeline to detect crop diseases from farmer-uploaded photos.
            
<h3>4.Farmers’ Voices – Weekend Advisory Sessions</h3>

* Content Creation: Recorded video/audio interviews with farmers and agri-students.

* Hosting & Streaming: Firebase Storage, YouTube private channels, or AWS S3 for low-latency streaming.

* Multilingual Subtitles: Auto-generated using STT + translation, then reviewed for accuracy.

* Notification System: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to notify users of new weekend sessions.



<h3>5.Data Security</h3>

* Data Protection: Encrypted storage of farmer data (crop type, soil info, location).

* Compliance: Aligned with government data security standards and agritech regulations

<h3>6.Multilingual & Voice Technology</h3>
      
* Speech-to-Text (STT): Google Speech API, Vosk, or Azure Cognitive Services for regional language support.

* Text-to-Speech (TTS): Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly, or open-source solutions for offline mode.


## Feasibility and Viability
<h2>Feasibility:</h2>

   <h4>1.Technical Feasibility:</h4>

* The solution leverages existing, proven technologies such as Flutter/React Native (cross-platform apps), Firebase (scalable backend), TensorFlow Lite (AI/ML for pest detection), and widely available APIs (weather, mandi prices, soil health).

* Multilingual and voice features can be implemented using Google Speech API, AWS Polly, or open-source STT/TTS models, ensuring accessibility for farmers with low literacy.

* Content delivery (weekly interviews) can be hosted via cloud storage or private YouTube channels, keeping infrastructure lightweight and cost-efficient.

  <h4>2.Operational Feasibility:</h4>

* The app requires minimal training for farmers due to icon-driven UI and voice interaction.

* Partnerships with agriculture universities, NGOs, and farmer cooperatives will ensure relevant content creation for interviews and advisories.

* The modular architecture allows for phased rollout (basic advisory first, followed by advanced AI features).

  <h4>3.Economic Feasibility </h4>

* Development and deployment costs are reduced by using cloud infrastructure and open-source tools.

* Long-term sustainability can be achieved through a freemium model (basic features free, advanced analytics or premium content subscription for larger farmers/organizations).

* Potential support from government schemes, CSR funds, and agri-tech partnerships reduces financial barriers.

<h2>Viability:</h2>
   <h4>1.Market Viability: </h4>
* 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022), representing a large and underserved market.

* Growing smartphone penetration in rural India (>67% in 2023) and availability of low-cost internet (Jio, BSNL) ensures digital access.

* Farmers are increasingly open to ICT-based advisory tools, which have shown yield improvements of 20–30% in studies.
  
  <h4>2.Social Viability: </h4>
* The platform directly contributes to food security, poverty reduction, and rural development.

* By combining traditional wisdom and modern science, it builds trust and credibility among farmers.
